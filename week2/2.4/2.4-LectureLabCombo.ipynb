    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this lab is to get comfortable with more advanced evaluation metrics and the intricacies of model performance/selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "* Name one situation when you would you use:\n",
    "  * Arithmetic mean\n",
    "  * Geometric mean\n",
    "  * Harmonic mean\n",
    "* Given two ROC curves, pick the best curve/threshold for the problem at hand\n",
    "* When would you use F_beta vs. AUC\n",
    "* State one reason why the Youden index is useful and one reason it can be misleading\n",
    "* __Exercise (next week):__ Construct a Profit curve to evaluate the precision/recall trade-off\n",
    "\n",
    "## Iteration Zero: Review (9:30 - 9:45)\n",
    "\n",
    "A classification problem is when we're trying to predict a discrete (categorical) outcome. We'll start with binary classification (i.e., yes/no questions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some example questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Does a patient have cancer?\n",
    "* Will a team win the next game?\n",
    "* Will the customer buy my product?\n",
    "* Will I get the loan?\n",
    "\n",
    "In binary classification, we assign labels of 0 and 1 to our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by looking at an example. We're going to be using some NFL data. The x axis is the number of touchdowns scored by team over a season and the y axis is whether they lost or won the game indicated by a value of 0 or 1 respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "![NFL data](images/nfl.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do we predict whether we have a win or a loss if we are given a score? Note that we are going to be predicting values between 0 and 1. Close to 0 means we're sure it's in class 0, close to 1 means we're sure it's in class 1, and closer to 0.5 means we don't know.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use linear regression, we will certainly do better than randomly guessing, but it doesn't accurately represent the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "![NFL linear regression](images/linefit.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So clearly a line is not the best way to model this data. So we need to find a better curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Iteration 1: Measuring success (9:45 - 10:00)\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we measure how well our model does? Just like with regression, we need to split the data in a training set and a test set and measure our success based on how well it does on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accuracy\n",
    "The simplest measure is **accuracy**. This is the number of correct predictions over the total number of predictions. It's the percent you predicted correctly. In `sklearn`, this is what the `score` method calculates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shortcomings of Accuracy\n",
    "Accuracy is often a good first glance measure, but it has many shortcomings. If the classes are unbalanced, accuracy will not measure how well you did at predicting. Say you are trying to predict whether or not an email is spam. Only 2% of emails are in fact spam emails. You could get 98% accuracy by always predicting not spam. This is a great accuracy but a horrible model!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confusion Matrix\n",
    "We can get a better picture our model but looking at the confusion matrix. We get the following four metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **True Positives (TP)**: Correct positive predictions\n",
    "* **False Positives (FP)**: Incorrect positive predictions (false alarm)\n",
    "* **True Negatives (TN)**: Correct negative predictions\n",
    "* **False Negatives (FN)**: Incorrect negative predictions (a miss)\n",
    "\n",
    "|            | Predicted Yes  | Predicted No   |\n",
    "| ---------- | -------------- | -------------- |\n",
    "| Actual Yes | True positive  | False negative |\n",
    "| Actual No  | False positive | True negative  |\n",
    "\n",
    "With logistic regression, we can visualize it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![logistic confusion matrix](images/logistic.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Precision, Recall and F1\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ysM0Z.png)\n",
    "Instead of accuracy, there are some other scores we can calculate:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Precision**: A measure of how good your positive predictions are\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Precison = TP / (TP + FP)\n",
    "             = TP / (predicted yes)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "* **Recall**: A measure of how well you predict positive cases. Aka *sensitivity*.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Recall = TP / (TP + FN) \n",
    "           = TP / (actual yes)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "* **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    F1 = 2 / (1/Precision + 1/Recall)\n",
    "       = 2 * Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall)\n",
    "       = 2TP / (2TP + FN + FP)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy can also be written in this notation:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + FP + TN + FN)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Precisionrecall.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arithmetic vs. Geometric vs. Harmonic means\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like there are many moments, there are many ways to compute a mean (scientists love generalization) and as such each has its own time and place.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/MathematicalMeans.svg/640px-MathematicalMeans.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "The arithmetic mean is the \"average\" we all have grown to know and love from elementary school and high school.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* Sum of values is significant (ex: grade in class computed from multiple grades on tests)\n",
    "* Need a 'typical' value as an aggregate: minimizes sum squared deviations \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Geometric Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "The geometric mean is quite similar to the arithmetic mean but uses the product of values rather than sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle GM = (\\prod_{i=1}^{n}x_{i})^\\frac{1}{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use:\n",

    "* Product of values is significant (ex: year over year return on an investment)\n",
    "\n",
    "__NOTE: The arithmetic mean is strictly larger than the geometric mean for non-negative real numbers.__\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Harmonic Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "The harmonic mean is by far encountered the least often (in usual applications) but when you do come across it however, it can be very useful.  The Harmonic mean is most often used when dealing with *ratios*.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H = \\frac{n}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\frac{1}{x_{i}}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "__It is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals...__\n",

    "* When you need to compute the F1 score ;)\n",

    "In K-fold cross validation, the data is split into **k** groups. One group\n",
    "out of the k groups will be the test set, the rest (**k-1**) groups will\n",

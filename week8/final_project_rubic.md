## 6003 Final Project

For this project, you will pick one of the user review datasets from [Text Analytics](http://www.text-analytics101.com/2011/07/user-review-datasets_20.html).  

__TODO__: Insert section on general goals, self choosen model, and assigned model

Explore each of the following steps and document your efforts:

1. ### Model:  
	- What model(s) did you choose? Why? 
	- For the models that you chose, find the code that implements the models. - Annotate the code by placing letters near each operation in the code that corresponds with the math used to describe the model. On a separate document (.txt) add descriptions to each letter, describing the math and reasoning behind each step of the model. 

2. ### Validation: 
	- What form of validation did you use? (e.g. k-fold cross-validation, etc.) Why? Provide reasoning grounded in the theory that was discussed in class.

3. ### Scoring:
	- Pick 2 metrics to score your model? (e.g. accuracy, F1, AUC, etc.) Why? Explain why these metric were a valuable part of your evaluation. 
	- Are there other metrics you could have used instead? Why didn’t you choose those? Describe the basic theory behind the metric in your own words (you may need to do additional research).

4. ### Ensemble:
	- Did you try any ensemble methods? If so, which ones?
	- Did they help? Why/why not? Provide reasoning. 

### Extra Credit
Explore advanced options of your choosing. Examples:  

- Applied unsupervised methods to support feature engineering.

***

For each of steps, we want both an empirical and a logical justification for the choices you made. That is: show us that the choice you picked is empirically superior to the alternative (better F1 score, etc.) and explain why you think that is.  

Each step is weighted equally. The only deliverable is an in-class presentation. The presentation style, or lack of style, (e.g., notebooks, code, and slides) will not be scored.

### Scoring: 
0 - Didn’t show up   
1 - Forgot to address that part of the project  
2 - Picked something but did not explore any alternatives  
3 - Justified choice logically but not empirically (i.e., considered alternatives but did not test them)  
4 - Justified choice empirically but not logically (i.e., demonstrated that one choice was better than others according to some metric, but no explanation as to why)  
5 - Justified choice both empirically and logically (i.e., demonstrated that one choice was better than others according to some metric and gave a convincing explanation as to why)

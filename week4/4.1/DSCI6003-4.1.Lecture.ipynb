    "# A brief review of recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to implement and understand Decision Trees (our next classification algorithm), we'll be using recursion. Recursion happens when a function calls itself. The idea is to reduce the problem into a simpler version of the same problem until you reduce it to what we call the *base case*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several math functions are naturally recursive. For example, *factorial*. Here's an example of factorial: `6! = 6*5*4*3*2*1 = 120`. You can also write it like this: `6! = 6 * 5!`. In this way, we've reduced it to a simpler version of the same problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fact(n):\n",
    "    if n == 0:\n",
    "        return 1\n",
    "    return n * fact(n - 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Fibonacci is another commonly seen example. The Fibonacci sequence is constructed by summing the two previous numbers to get the next number. Here's the sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 11, 21, 33, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fibonacci(n):\n",

    "        return n\n",
    "    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also write a sum function, which sums a list, recursively:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def sum(lst):\n",
    "    if not lst:\n",
    "        return 0\n",
    "    return lst[0] + sum(lst[1:])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that every recursive problem has two cases (can be more too):\n",
    "\n",
    "* The *Base Case*: This is the stopping point or minimal example. It's an empty list or when an integer is 0. It's the simplest problem that can't be reduced any more.\n",
    "* The *Recursive Step*: This is where all the work is done. We reduce the problem into a smaller version of the same problem (in solving factorial of n we reduced the problem to solving factorial of n - 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trees\n",
    "The examples above can also be easily written *iteratively* (using loops instead of recursion), but there are instances where recursion is really key.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *tree* in computer science is a *data structure* (way of storing data) which looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "         8\n",

    "# Decision trees\n",
    " \n",
    "[Decision trees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning) are one of the most popular and widely used algorithms in industry today. Most classifiers (SVM, kNN, Naive Bayes) are great at giving you a (somewhat) accurate result, but are often black boxes in that it can be hard to interpret their parameters and thus *understand why* a certain instance was assigned a specific label. Regressions provide a middle ground in that it is possible to assign relationships between features and targets but it is often to assign a causal relationship amongst the inputs (Lasso/Elastic net is a way of getting at this problem). Decision trees are unique among any standard model in that they are both flexible and accurate while also being easily interpreted.\n",

    "\n",
    "## How to build a Decision Tree\n",
    "How to predict with a decision tree it pretty clear: you just answer the questions and follow the path to the appropriate *leaf* node. But how do we build a decision tree? How do we determine which feature we should split on? This is the crux of the decision tree algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by dealing with a particular type of decision tree, where we only do binary splits. To do a binary split:\n",
    "\n",
    "* for a categorical variable, choose either value or not value (e.g. sunny or not sunny)\n",
    "* for a continuous variable, choose a threshold and do > or <= the value (e.g. temperature <75 or >=75)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Information Gain\n",
    "In order to pick which feature to split on, we need a way of measuring how good the split is. This is what *information gain* is for. The *gini impurity* is another alternative, which we'll discuss later.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to discuss *entropy*. The entropy of a set is a measure of the amount of disorder. Intuitively, if a set has all the same labels, that'll have low entropy and if it has a mix of labels, that's high entropy. We would like to create splits that minimize the entropy in each size. If our splits do a good job splitting along the boundary between classes, they have more predictive power.\n",

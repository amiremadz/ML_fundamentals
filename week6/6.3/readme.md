##Instructions for the GMM lab

1. Use the lecture example (Example 1) to help you. Your job is simply to replicate Hastie's results, as given to you in the lecture. 

2. Fill in each function carefully.

3. Use the Hastie data (given to you in the lab handout) to test your code. You should be able to get the table given in example 1.

4. Keep trying. Make sure to streamline your work process (work efficiently).

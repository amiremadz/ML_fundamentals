## Gap Statistic

For today's lab, we will walk through a Python implementation of the Gap statistic to get a better intuition for what goes into the method.

## Pre-work

* [Data Science for Business (p. 187-232)](resources/cs194-cross-validate.pdf)

## Goals

* Why is the silhouette typically a better measure than the "elbow method"?
* Why is the Gap Statistic thought of as an improvement on the Silhouette?
* What are the two approaches to bound the reference dataset created?
    * Which is more "correct"?
* Draw 4 scatterplots in which:
    * The elbow method gives a good estimate for the true $k$
    * The elbow method gives an inconclusive result but the Silhouette estimates $k$ correctly
    * Both the elbow method and Silhouette give inconclusive results but the Gap statistic correctly estimates $k$
    * None of the methods correctly estimates $k$
